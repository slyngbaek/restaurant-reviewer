<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>During my visit to SLO Brew, I ordered the Brew Burger with cheese. The burger was still quite cool in the center and was quite peppery. The fries were good, but overall, I was somewhat disappointed with my meal.</p>
<p>Service was just ok. It took us quite a while to get our food, but our drinks stayed full. The waitress was quite nice and talked to us for a while, but it is hard to be forgiving when it takes 30 minutes to get your food.</p>
<p>The venue is great. SLO Brew is right in the middle of downtown and they regularly hold concerts downstairs. We were there during soundcheck and thump of the bass barely penetrated the floor. The restaurant upstairs has TVs along all the walls and fermenting vats behind the bar. It is a great place to hang out and has a nice brewery feel.</p>
<p>Overall, I wasn't too enthused with SLO Brew. The food was mediocre and took too long to serve, but the location is nice and the people are great. If you are looking for a good beer downtown, check it out, but if you are looking for some real food, I would have to take a pass.</p></body></html>
