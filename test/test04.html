<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Overall, the food at California Pizza Kitchen (CPK) is of a higher quality nature, and is usually quite tasty. It's often made in an open kitchen where you can see the cooks at work, which is nice for anyone who is picky about who makes their food. In addition, their deserts are often the primary reason that people will go to CPK in the first place. </p>
<p>I went to CPK with my girlfriend, roommate, and his girlfriend. We got a square table for the four of us. Overall, CPK seemed to be busy, with many waiters bustling around everywhere. We got menu's relatively quickly, and had our orders filled promptly. In terms of food arrival time, however, it took about 15 minutes, a little longer than we expected in the beginning. In addition, when we were ready to pay, our waiter took about 15 minutes just to realize that our check was filled out. </p>
<p>The venue at CPK is a mix of professional and casual, definitely upper-scale than a standard bar or burger joint such as Eureka. It has decent furnishings, and is spacious overall. It can be a bit cramped in some corners, but I've been in worse. </p>
<p>Overall, we had a good experience at CPK. The food was tasty, and the service was decent if slightly delayed. All in all, I'd go back again in the future. </p></body></html>
