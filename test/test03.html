<p class="p1">WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p class="p1">Vieni Vai offers authentic italian food at a somewhat reasonable price. The pizzas and calzones are handmade and cooked to perfection in a stone oven. Complementary bread is also served with a delicious olive and eggplant tapenade. Last but not least, Vieni Via offers a large assortment of deserts including a tiramisu that was featured on the Rachel Ray Show. Great quality food for those willing to spend an extra couple of dollars.</p>
<p class="p1">The service at Vieni Vai complements that of a italian restaurant; white table-cloths, prompt waiters, and refills on bread. The waiters are friendly and check on you periodically. The food is served in a timely manner and arrives hot from the oven. The waiters will happily provide their opinion on the foods and knowledgable on the ingredients of all the dishes.</p>
<p class="p1">Vieni Vai is located in downtown San Luis Obispo along the creek. The atmosphere is cozy and reminiscent of Italy, with authentic decor and mood lighting. During the day-time they also offer patio seating along the creek. This is definitely one of the nicer locations to dine at with its warm and relaxing, possibly romantic, atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p1">Overall, Vieni Vai provides excellent food and great service at a somewhat reasonable price. They have location great for any date or family gathering. So if you are looking for a place dine-in and enjoy authentic italian food, this place is for you.</p></body></html>
