<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Petra Cafe is a great Mediterranean restaurant just outside of downtown San Luis Obispo.  It is situated direction next to Jaffa Cafe, another Mediterranean restaurant.  In my opinion, Petra has better food and better people.</p>
<p>Petra Cafe's food is fantastic.  The falafel is scrumptous, the lamb shawarma is to die for, and the pizzas are out of this world.  The plates come with hummus, greek yogurt, and pita bread, which are all top notch.  There is also a few sauces available, including an incredible garlic butter concoction which will leave you with garlic breath for days.</p>
<p>The service is as good as can be.  The owner and his son are very nice, will greet you with "Hello, my friend" if they recognize you.  Many times I've brought a date here, and the owner always seems to notice, and brings us free desert and pita bread.  They always make you feel welcome and appreciated.</p>
<p>The actual venue leaves something to be desired.  It's a fairly plain building, with standard tables, chairs, and a tv.  There is a lower room downstairs through the kitchen with a few tables.  The place is fairly crowded for space, and its hard to walk by if there are people sitting down. </p>
