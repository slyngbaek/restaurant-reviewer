<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>19 Metro Station provide food for hungry CalPoly students. I go there almost every day to fill my stomach. It offers various kinds of food including salada bars and Asian food such as fried rice and Chowmein noodle in buffet style. I am getting tired of the food because the menu is changed only weekly and very slightly. The other thig I do not like about it is that any not drink such as coffee is not offered there.</p>
<p>The level of service at 19 Metro Station is average. It is not very good, but I do not expect more for a buffet style restaurant. One thing I do not like about its service is that it is not open everyday.</p>
<p>19 Metro Station is conveniently situated on campus. I always try to avoid the peek hour when many students go there. During the peek hour, I have to wait in a long que to get food and it is very difficult to find an empty table.</p>
<p>Overall, 19 Metro Station is not a good place to eat. But, as a campus dining place I think it is average or slightly below average. In other words, I do not think I should expect much from a restaurant like 19 Metro Station.</p></body></html>
