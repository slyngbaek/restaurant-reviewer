<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Sal's has some of the best sandwiches in Downtown SLO. There is a wide selection of great sandwiches, with lots of topping options. Everything is fresh and their sandwiches seem perfectly constructed.</p>
<p>The service is pretty much what you'd expect. Unfortunately, they did make a small mistake on my sandwich, but were very apologetic and gave me the forgotten topping on the side.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of downtown, Sal's is a great place to hang out for a bit. There is lots of seating both inside and out with bit tables incase you have a large party. The outdoor seating is great on nice days.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a great sandwich downtown, Sal's is definitely the place to go. They also have a pretty wide beer selection if you want to try some out which you enjoy your sandwich. You also get a lollipop with your sandwich for dessert!</p></body></html>
