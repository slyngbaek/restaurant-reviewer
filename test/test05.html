Yanagi Sushi and Grill is located on Marsh Street in San Luis Obispo, and has been voted some of the best sushi in San Luis Obispo for several years running. Their sushi is quite excellent, and they serve a variety of other dishes for anyone looking for something more or someone who may not be interested in the 'raw fish' part of sushi.</p>
<p>Upon frequenting Yanagi this very night, I was thorougly impressed with the service, which was prompt, courteous, and efficient. Even my girlfriend, who was a waiter for several years, was impressed with the service. Everyone working had a ready smile and quick feet.</p>
<p>The venue has a very friendly atmosphere and excellent lighting. Some of the signs on the wall are a bit, shall we say, cheap printer paper, but they get the job done and are simply displaying some of the special roll options, so they don't require fancy printing or lamination. We went slightly earlier in the night, so there wasn't any overcrowding, and the noise level was completely fine. I wouldn't mind sitting at the sushi bar eventually, but we settled on a booth for this visit.</p>
<p>Overall, my girlfriend and I had an excellent experience at Yanagi Sushi. We had good food, great service, and a nice ambiance. I will certainly return to Yanagi again in the future.</p></body></html>
