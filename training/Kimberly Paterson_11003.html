<p dir="ltr"><span>The food at Tacos de Acapulco is fairly authentic Mexican food for a decent price. You get a lot of food for the price and you leave with a full belly. I ordered the #2 combo, 2 carnitas tacos and a side of rice and beans, but my friends ordered the big burrito with chips, the #12. For $9 bucks you get a big meal and the food is tasty, if a little greasy. You also get free drink refills, which you’ll need with that big burrito! It’s definitely not very healthy food, and there aren’t many veggie options for people who don’t like meat, but if you like meat, I recommend the Carne Asada or Carnitas. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The service here is actually really good. I’ve been coming here for 5 years and the staff always seems to be having a good time. They’re polite to you when you order and when they ask you what you want on your burrito, taco, etc. They are usually smiling or enjoying the music. Food always comes out fast too, which is nice. The staff doesn’t wear gloves when they prepare your food, but they wash their hands, and after 5 years, I’ve never gotten sick from their food, so it isn’t a big deal. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The place is a little hokey feeling, with the mural painted on the wall, but the place is clean and has a nice open, airy feel. The best part is the hispanic music they always play, which varies from music like mariachi and spanish pop/rock. The music is fun and even though it’s not my personal favorite, it brings character to the place and it feels very weird when there isn’t music. There’s outside seating as well, but they’re just wooden picnic tables, which aren’t too great on your legs, but work if the place is crowded.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>Overall, of all the Mexican restaurants in San Luis Obispo, Tacos de Acapulco is definitely my favorite. It feels authentic and the food tastes authentic, which is a big plus if you like real Mexican food. Since my friends and I discovered this place as freshmen, it has always been our go-to place when we crave greasy Mexican food. We always forget it isn’t open on Sundays though, so if you’re craving Mexican food on a Sunday, you’ll have to, sadly, go somewhere else. Tacos de is one of the hidden gems of SLO and not too many people know about it. It’s a great place to go to get away from downtown crowding and get some real food. </span></p>
