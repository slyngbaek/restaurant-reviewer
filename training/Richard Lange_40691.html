<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>F.McLintocks is a ranch-style restaurant that is known for its steaks and ribs. The restaurant is rather pricey, but it offers high quality food <br />and service. F.McLintocks also has a view of Pismo Beach. The interior of the restaurant is ranch themed and there are numerous animal trophies and other western decorations. Unlike many popular attractions in Shell Beach, F.Mclinktocks has its own parking.</p>
<p>The food at F.McLintocks is fantastic, and there's plenty of it. Unlike other high price restaurants, F.McLintocks offers a ton of food with each meal. For example, if you order a steak, you also get beans, potatoes, and various other sides included with your meal. The steaks are delicious and the portions have a higher cost to weight ratio than other expensive steak establishments (such as Flemmings). The appetizers provided with the meal are also excellent. It is not difficult to enter F.McLintocks extremely hungry and leave full.</p>
<p>In addition to the excellent food, the service is pretty good. The servers seemed very attentive to drink refills, order placements, and bringing out the check. The servers are also very laid back and give the venue a casual feel. The servers can often be seen performing tricks, such as pouring water into a cup on a kid's head while they are standing on a chair. Despite these pluses, I wouldn't say the service was perfect. There were a few instances (very few) where we had to wait for a server to come around to give me a refill, or provide more bread. Although this happened very rarely, this is the reason I can't give F.McLintocks a perfect service score.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of F.McLintocks is the atmosphere of the venue. The decorations are all "western", which doesn't make it seem like a fancy restaurant, but rather a casual barbeque house. As someone that hates the requirement that one should dress up to go out to an expensive restaurant, I am glad that this requirement doesn't apply to F.McLintocks. When I ate there, there weren't many people dressed up. In addition to the relaxed nature of the venue, the venue also has a great location; it is located on a hill overlooking Pismo Beach, offering a beautiful view of the ocean. The view, the relaxed atmosphere, and the food are ultimately what gives F.McLintocks its place on my top 15 favorite restaurants. Eating fancy without dressing fancy is very enjoyable.</p></body></html>
