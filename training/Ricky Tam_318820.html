<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>This was my first time eating at Ciopinot and the food was pretty good. They had an amazing seafood selection to choose from. I chose the swordfish dish and my friend chose the seafood salad. I tried both of them and, immediately, I knew the food was good. It wasn’t the best food I’ve ever had at a fancy type restaurant, but it was still good. I paired my swordfish with their recommended glass of wine and it complimented my entree so well. For dessert, we had their creme brulee which was one of the better tasting ones I’ve had; not too sweet and the texture was nicely done.</p>
<p>The service there was really good, but it wasn’t as great as other places. They came by once in awhile to ask us how we were doing, but they didn’t continue conversations if you started one with them. They are really friendly and it made the atmosphere really enjoyable. The food came out relatively fast as well. I believe the service could have been better, but it was good for what I expected.</p>
<p>The venue was pretty nice in my opinion. The layout was a bit different than what I usually see at restaurants like this. They had a bar and grill area to the right of the entrance and the rest of the seating areas were for fancy dining. The bar and grill area was normal, but the fancy dining area had nice designs and decor around it. For example, we sat next to a fountain that flowed smoothly on a surface; it added a nice, calm mood to our dining. The ambiance was also just right, but I don’t know if it would be louder if more people were there.</p>
<p>Overall, Ciopinot is an above average restaurant for dining in. Their selection of seafood makes me want to go back and try most of their dishes. The wine selection they have is also excellent; it even includes my favorite: Royal Tokaji. The service is above average, but it can also be better. The venue has a nice ambiance to it and the decor around the tables make it even better. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends.</p></body></html>
