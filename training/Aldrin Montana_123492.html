<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is a BBQ restaurant that primarily serves burgers, BBQ<br />ribs, BBQ chicken, and various sandwiches. The selection was not terribly<br />diverse, but they had 'Killer Garlic Fries' which were sure to be a great hit.<br />Sure enough, their BBQ tastes quite good and their garlic fries lived up to my<br />expectations of garlic-ness. Although, thinking back on it, it wasn't<br />particularly memorable, so despite it being good and me quite enjoying it, I<br />wonder if it wasn't exceptional, hence the 4.</p>
<p>Service at Moe's smokehouse was wonderful, at least as far as BBQ grill<br />restaurants go. It didn't necessarily have the typical male server or register<br />worker that really gives BBQ or bar and grill restaurants a feel of ruggedness.<br />However, the servers were quick to bring us our food, and despite not expecting<br />any service they even asked if we needed anything a couple times. I think as<br />far as BBQ restaurants goes Moe's, at least today, had quite good service.</p>
<p>Moe's atmosphere was quite typical: A walk up register where you order, a soda<br />fountain, and a look and feel very similar to most BBQ restaurants I've been<br />to. Although, that being said, I also didn't pay much attention to any of their<br />pictures and artwork. I may have missed out on the appeal of the restaurant<br />itself but I didn't think there is anything I would consider memorable<br />decorating their walls.</p>
<p>Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is exactly what you would expect, plus bonus taste and<br />service. I think it is definitely a good place to go every once in awhile. Of<br />course, being a BBQ restaurant it shouldn't be frequented too often, but the<br />price is affordable for a fair amount of food (including a lot of fries) and<br />the overall experience is quite comforting.</p></body></html>
