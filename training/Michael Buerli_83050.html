<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Domino's Pizza offers a good amount of pizza at a cheap price. The quality however is hit-or-miss, with varying amounts of greasiness or lack of sauce. If you are a college student cramming for a midterm this might be the right midnight feast, however if you have any regard for how your stomach will feel in the hour following this place is NOT for you. Their food can be disgustingly greasy and is best consumed with a soda or some TUMS.</p>
<p>The service at Domino's is perhaps its redeeming quality. Food is prepared quickly and delivered even quicker. But wait, there is more, you have an awesome status bar to show how far along the process your order is. Whether you are at home, or picking up carry-out, the service is speedy and estimated down to the minute.</p>
<p>The venue, in this case Domino's storefront, has much to be desired. It is simply a counter where you can order your food with a nice view of the guys throwing together your order. The alternative (recommended) venue is your own house, which one would hope is quite a bit nicer. While Domino's venue cannot be compared to a restaurant, even for a carryout location it is minimalist and lacking everything.</p>
<p>Overall, Domino's Pizza is by no means a place to enjoy a healthy meal. The food is delivered in quantity rather than with quality. So while the service is great, Domino's should be limited to late-night gatherings and consumed in very small doses.</p></body></html>
