<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Upper Crust Trattoria is an italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food has<br />several very good qualities: very good taste (especially the soup), abundant<br />bread (unlimited actually), and good proportions. Although I may have ate more<br />bread than the average bear, I think that the size of the proportions leave you<br />satisfied and if necessary the bread is unlimited. Additionally, the bread goes<br />marvelously well both with the pasta sauce and the soup broth. The soup broth<br />had a very noticeable taste but not particularly overwhelming. The only problem<br />I had with the food was that the pasta itself was not particularly flavored,<br />but the meat (I had chicken marsala) tasted so absolutely wonderful it more<br />than made up for the lack of succulence in the pasta.</p>
<p>The service at Upper Crust was also very good. If my waiter was walking by the<br />table, we were sure to be asked how our food tasted and if we had any needs.<br />The servers were also nice, appropriately talkative, and quick to smile.</p>
<p>Upper Crust had a definite atmosphere of elegance established. Much of the<br />furniture was made of some sort of wood, or made to look like wood, and the<br />lighting was dim and warm. We had been placed in front of a fireplace (though<br />not lit) that even gave the restaurant a sort of cozy at home feel.<br />Additionally there was an awesome drunk guy that tried his hand at chatting<br />with some ladies that was particularly amusing.</p>
<p>Overall, Upper Crust far exceeded my expectations. From the outside appearance<br />and the name I wasn't sure if the place was just a fancy pizza place beyond the<br />likes of California Pizza Kitchen. To my surprise, Upper Crust was a very great<br />tasting italian restaurant with quite a bit of style and personality. I would<br />highly recommend Upper Crust to anyone and everyone (though it's expensive).</p></body></html>
