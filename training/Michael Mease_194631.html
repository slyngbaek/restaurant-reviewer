<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Domino's is a decent place to get a cheap pizza. Despite the low price, however, the food really isn't that great. I did not throw the pizza away, but the crust was very thin and, overall, the pizza was not very filling. The texture of the bottom crust was also very messy. I much prefer slightly more expensive pizza places that have thicker slices and better ingredients. The price and convenience are the only two reasons I would eat at Domino's.</p>
<p>As for the service at Domino's, everyone was very helpful. The employees were friendly and I got my pizza in a relatively short amount of time. There was not much interaction, but the staff did their job well enough.</p>
<p>The actual storefront is very small at Domino's. It doesn't need to be very big however, as Domino's is primarily a take-out/delivery restaurant. There was seating for people who would wait for their orders, but only for about three people. The floors and counter looked clean and it looked like everything in the back was kept tidy as well. Being such a small place, one cannot expect too much.</p>
<p>Overall, Domino's is just a cheap, last-resort style place. The pizza's are not that bad, but could be better. The deals they have a decent amount of value, and ordering online is streamlined since Domino's is a big franchise. i only plan on eating here a few times this year, and only when I am really craving some pizza.</p>
