The two meals ordered, steak and stir-fry, were both prepared as as requested. The meat was very flavorful, tender, and juicy - exactly as it should be. The steak had a delicious marinate, which was enjoyed by those who tried it and was agreed to be very well done. The stir-fry was pleasantly tasty, and did not rely on excess oil to give it flavor. The tofu, while slightly less flavorful due to the nature of the food, was nevertheless prepared well and was enjoyable. The sides were also very good, with "crispy sushi rice" presenting a pleasant surprise. The only drawback to the food at Big Sky was that it seemed as though the margins were fairly small, given the cost. That being said, the quality was very good, and was thus still a worthwhile purchase.</p>
<p>The service was very good. The wait staff was attentive and polite, and could answer questions when asked for information. Drinks were refilled promptly, and, as is the norm, the food was confirmed to be good. There was nothing particularly outstanding about the service; however, since the experience was without significant issue, there was no cause for any exceptional behavior on the part of the wait staff. In other words, the service was as would be expected in a good restaurant, and was neither higher nor lower than this standard.</p>
<p>The venue at Big Sky was actually very pleasant. While the restaurant is not large, it is nevertheless roomy enough that one does not feel cramped. Additionally, the entire restaurant presents a pleasant level of volume - neither being so loud that customers could not hear one another without shouting, nor so quiet that it would be awkward to talk. Additionally, the feel of Big Sky was very nice - the artwork was enjoyable and of decent quality, and the furniture matched the decor to provide a coherent, yet comfortable, setting.</p>
<p>The trip to Big Sky was very enjoyable. We were presented with good food, above average service, and an excellent environment. While the trip was somewhat costly in comparison to other restaurants, the price was not prohibitive, and it did not detract from the enjoyment of the visit. Overall, Big Sky Cafe is a good recommendation for a restaurant, especially if the customer is looking for a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere in which to enjoy a meal.</p></body></html>
