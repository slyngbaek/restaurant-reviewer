<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Eureka Burger is, as its name suggests, a great place to get burgers at reasonable prices. Eureka burger has a medium-sized, well kept dining area with a bar. The restaurant does not have outdoor seating, but does have two stories for customers to eat at.</p>
<p>The food at Eureka tastes pretty good. Most of the meat is well prepared so that every burger tastes great. The true beauty of the establishment is the atmosphere, however, which makes it a great place to spend a sunday night. Their rolls and sides are also very tasty, and go well with the variety of products they sell (especially since my "sides" were on the actual burger.) For a restaurant, the selection of items is not extensive, but what I got was tasty.</p>
<p>The setting is great and typical of a burger joint: a bar, big screen tv's with sports, and classic wooden furniture. The venue is not really suited for families but is a decent place to go with a group of friends. The service was pretty good, but nothing special.</p>
<p>Overall, Eureka burger was a nice place to eat at. The floors and tables are well maintained, so eating there felt fine. The only real flaws with the venue are its limited size and the fact that its not much of a family place. Otherwise, I would definitely eat there again.</p></body></html>
