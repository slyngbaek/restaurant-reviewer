<p dir="ltr"><span>Kona’s Deli is a great place to get delicious sandwiches. The sandwiches come on two different types of sweet bread that makes the whole sandwich more delicious. I usually get the wheat bread, but the white bread is the hawaiian sweet bread that tastes yummy. The best part about Kona’s sandwiches is that you get a lot of meat, which is always fresh and thinly sliced. You get a LOT of food here, for what you pay (a full sandwich is about 8 bucks). The only downside is that they charge for some toppings and they don’t have that many different veggie selections. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The service here is decent. Usually the staff is either hanging out behind the counter or out in the dining area. They are always polite, but they usually don’t seem to be enjoying the work. If it weren’t for the delicious food, then I would be put-off by the service a little. Overall, they seem to do a decent job, but you can tell that the staff is not invested in smiling or enjoying themselves. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>The venue here is sort of kitschy, with lots of local (and wacky) art on the walls and sort of a Hawaiian theme. The tables are not really comfortable, and there aren’t many of them in the dining area. However, if the weather is nice, you can sit outside on the picnic benches. The staff usually plays interesting music so it’s not uncomfortable. Overall, the place has a quiet atmosphere that is comfortable enough. It is conveniently located near Cal Poly’s campus, so it makes it a quick meal option for those who don’t want campus food. </span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>I come to Kona’s Deli for the food, which means I don’t really mind that the place feels a lot like a glorified Subway. The bread is delicious and the sandwiches are filling and fresh, which makes the place a lot better than some other sandwich shops in SLO. Kona’s may not be the best sandwich place in town, but the food is good and decently priced for the quality and quantity of the food you get. </span></p>
