<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Noi's Little Thai Takeout (Noi's) is a small counter-top restaurant. Noi's offers several basic Thai noodle and rice dishes daily, but a different curry each day of the week. Noi's is not the cheapest restaurant, though the food is certainly worth the price and comes in large quantities. A large dish of curry will run you ~$10; noodle or rice dishes are ~$9, it is easy to make two smaller meals out of one menu item. Though I don't consider myself a Thai food expert, I prefer Noi's to any other Thai food in the San Luis Obispo region. The food is beautifully prepared. Where other Thai foods try to impress you with a large menu, Noi's keeps the menu simple but excellent.</p>
<p>Because Noi's is take out only, the food is usually ready within a couple minutes. The the employees are friendly and helpful. Behind the counter, there is an open, busy kitchen where you can see your meal prepared. Noi's is very clean.</p>
<p>Living in San Luis Obispo makes getting to Noi's inconvenient. Noi's is in Los Osos and is about a 20 minute drive and there are no public transportation options. Once you arrive, there is plenty of parking in the parking lot and on the street nearby. Noi's itself is small and there isn't much room to eat inside, but there is plenty of outdoor seating and the weather in Los Osos is usally very mild. Noi's also has a small outdoor garden with seating and it's usually quiet in downtown Los Osos.</p>
<p>It's difficult to pick one aspect that makes Noi's excellent. The simple menu focuses on a few key dishes which are certain to satisfy. Though it is somewhat more expensive than an average lunch, the portions are large. Service is quick and friendly without being over-the-top. Location is certainly a drawback, but Noi's quaint atmosphere completes the food experience.</p></body></html>
