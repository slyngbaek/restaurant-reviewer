<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Denny’s is a breakfast food restaurant similar to IHOP. Denny’s has cheap delicious food at a great price. The pancakes I ordered were amazing.</p>
<p>Denny’s had excellent service. The waiter was extremely fast at getting us our drinks, food and our receipts. All of the staff members were really nice to us.</p>
<p>Denny’s has an alright location. Unfortunately, when I went there was no parking so I had to park at the hotel next door. There were plenty of tables inside to sit at though.</p>
<p>Denny’s is an excellent sit-down breakfast restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious. The staff was extremely nice to me. Sadly, when I went the parking lot was full. Besides that I highly recommend Denny’s.</p></body></html>
