<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>This is a five start place through and through. The food was delicious. They even had great bread. I had the chicken parmesan, and it was great. However, I think that the soup was the most delicious. I had a garlic chicken tomato soup.</p>
<p>The service was great. The people were friendly on responsive.</p>
<p>The venue was one of the most spectacular things about this place. It had really warm lighting and fancy decor. We sat right next to a fireplace.</p>
<p>The only complaint I have is the price, this place is not cheap. Especially for a lowly grad student. Besides that, it was a really enjoyable experience. Also, their beer selection was lacking and the wines were too expensive.</p></body></html>
