<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Snowshoe Brewing Company is a restaurant with a wide variety of food and homemade brew.  It serves both lunch and dinner.  Snowshoe Brewing Company is in the town of Arnold, CA.  Arnold has a population of 3,843.  The restaurant resides next to what use to be a small golf course (9 holes) that has now gone unattended and looks more like a meadow. Parking is plenty.</p>
<p>Snowshoe Brewing Company specializes in brewing its own beer.  From a Snoweizen Wheat Ale to a Grizzly Brown Ale, the choices are ample.  It also serves wine.  Snowshoe Brewing Company has a large menu.  From burgers to fish tacos, sandwiches to fajitas, pizza to prime rib, the choices are plentiful.  The prices range from $5 to $11 for an appetizer to $10 to $21 for a dinner entrée.  The atmosphere is quaint, like the town, and the waitresses are friendly.</p>
<p>Snowshoe Brewing Company is busiest during winter season because of Bear Valley Ski Resort.  It has a rustic décor with snowshoes hanging in its cabin-like setting.  Video games to one side of the interior make the restaurant inviting for families with children.  It does provide take-out services and has two televisions inside the restaurant which are displaying the current sporting events. </p>
<p>Snowshoe Brewing Company is one of the highlights to visiting Arnold, CA.  The food quality and prices are very good as the meal portions are large.  Waiting time can be long if the restaurant is crowded.  Snowshoe Brewing Company does not take reservations so it is first come, first serve.  It also sells merchandise with its logo and “growlers” (to go beer containers).</p></body></html>
