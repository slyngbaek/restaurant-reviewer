Shalimar offers a selection of well-known and well-prepared Indian dishes and beverages, such as chicken tikka masala and mango lassi. While quite nondescript from the outside, the interior of the restaurant is inviting, but slightly eclectic. Coupled with quick and friendly service, Shalimar is an excellent choice for Indian food in San Luis Obispo.<br /><br />If you’re a college student on a budget and have a mid-day craving for Indian food, Shalimar’s lunch buffet is hard to beat. The buffet is all-you-can-eat and reasonably priced, but slightly more expensive than other Indian restaurants in town. However, the quality of the food and especially service more than makes up for it. A good selection of dishes is available in the buffet, from salads to entrees, and desserts. Almost every dish that I have tried was flavorful and well-prepared, and the spicy dishes had a perfect amount of heat. The gulab jamun (fried milk balls in rosewater and sugar syrup), however, was a little dry and gritty at first, but was tasty after broken up and soaked in the syrup. Service was quick and cheerful, and since there was almost nobody else in the restaurant, I was seated and served immediately. The lunch buffet is self-serve, as expected, so you can try a little or a lot of everything. <br /><br />From the outside, Shalimar looks a little like a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, but is fairly nice on the inside. The walls are painted bright, cheerful colors, and there are a lot of decorative elements as well as a fish tank. I did not really care for the bar and TV being in close proximity with the comparatively serene dining area, or for the large signs showing various awards the restaurant has won.<br /><br />I highly recommend Shalimar if you’re looking for a quick, tasty, and filling lunch, or otherwise, simply if you enjoy Indian food. The venue is lighthearted, yet provides a nice atmosphere for a more sophisticated experience. The service is professional and leaves nothing left to be desired. Overall, Shalimar is a must-visit.</p></body></html>
