I have never been disappointed by the food at Firestone. Every time I visit is just as delicious as the last. I ordered the tri-tip sandwich which is one of the more expensive options. It was definitely worth the price, the soft and crunchy buttered bread combined with Firestone's BBQ sauces makes it awesome. Also, I got an order of fries and a side of BBQ and ranch sauce. The fries come with a seasoning that is unique to Firestone. I dipped the fries in barbeque and ranch sauce for the best flavors.<br /><br />Firestone Grill has almost no service. You order when you get to the front of the line, there is always a long line at Firestone, and then you pick up your food when your number gets called. Ranch and barbeque sauce has to be requested when you pick up your food. Napkins and drinks are self-serve. When I ordered by tri-tip sandwich it came much later than the food of some of the people I was with, so I had to wait while everyone else was eating. Firestone Grill is not known for its quality or speedy service.<br /><br />Firestone always has a lively and crowded atmosphere. There was a big line when we went. The outside area was pretty cold when we went so we looked for a table inside. There is no guarantee that you will find a table inside, especially not for 10 people. Firestone grill does have a big outdoor area with cool night lights. The inside area has big televisions everywhere showing sports and it generally has a cool, dimly lit,  hang-out atmosphere.<br /><br />There are some negatives about Firestone, such as the slow service and no guarantee that setting can be found indoors. However, the delicious food and good atmosphere make up for it. I generally recommend Firestone Grill to anyone in San Luis Obispo who hasn’t been there yet.</p></body></html>
