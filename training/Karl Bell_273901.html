<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>The Habit Burger Grill is a fast-food burger joint. Their food reflects this - they have a small selection of burgers and sandwiches, along with some sides like fries and onion rings. I had a teriyaki pineapple burger. These kinds of burgers aren’t always available at fast food places, so I figured I would try it. It was pretty good; a fair amount better than most nationwide fast food chains like McDonalds or whatever. It was pretty inexpensive, too. The fries were better than I expected.</p>
<p>The service was pretty good. It’s an order first then pick up later place, so there’s not much to say. They use a pager-like device (the kind that a lot of places use to notify you when a table is ready) to let you know when your order is ready, so there’s no unnecessary shouting. I went with one other person, though, and they only gave us one order of fries (even though we asked for two). I just let it go as a mistake of the person who took our order. Maybe we weren’t speaking super clearly (it was a bit loud).</p>
<p>The restaurant was pretty cramped when we went. The line was just about out the door. It moved pretty quickly, though. The only open table after we ordered was on the left side of the line, but when our food was ready, we had to pick it up on the right side, which required some navigation of the line (since it was still out to the door). I’m not sure the layout could be improved much in the space they are working with, though.</p>
<p>Overall, one of the cheapest places to eat downtown, where the burgers are worth the money and the fries are actually really good. It gets a bit hectic when it’s crowded, but getting your food is made easier by the technology they use.</p></body></html>
