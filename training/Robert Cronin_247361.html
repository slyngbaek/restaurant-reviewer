<p>Alphys Chateau Basque seemed to go for an approach which dictated that quantity was of greater importance than quality. While the price of the food was steep, with the average entree priced at around twenty-five dollars, the amount of food given to the customer is outrageous. It includes several courses, comprised of soup, beans, and bread; salad and beef tongue; potatoes, carrots, pasta, and the ordered entrees; followed finally by a scoop of ice cream. This, clearly, is an outrageous amount of food, which is far in excess of what would be required. Unfortunately, the quality of the food is not quite as high as the amount. Many entrees were too salty, and many of the meats seemed undercooked. Nothing was of above-average quality, with much falling below par, and the price meant that there was much left wanted.</p>
<p>The service provided to us was neither fantastic nor terrible; it was merely average. The wait staff was reasonably attentive, and sure to refill drinks and verify that the order was correct. Upon asking, they provided boxes or other requests. However, it is not the fact that the service was lacking in any particular area, but rather the fact that the price indicated the service would be better.</p>
<p>The venue was also less than desired. Unfortunately, the front door was left open during the meal, allowing the cold ocean air to waft inside. Many customers were wearing their jackets for warmth from this breeze. Additionally, half the restaurant was celebrating the German holiday of Oktoberfest. While this is certainly good to see, the loud band playing stereotypical (and not real) German music was rather annoying. This was only made worse when they attempted to play songs not of the genre, as very little is more terrifying than hearing Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall" played with what sounded like bad German Polka. Coupled with the again-stereotypical Liederhosen worn by the wait staff, and the venue gave an overall impression of trying too hard and not knowing the culture which they were imitating. Additionally, the band necessitated the near-shouting of every patron and member of the wait staff, creating a very loud environment.</p>
<p>The experience at this restaurant was, overall, fairly mediocre. The best aspect of the restaurant is easily the amount of food given, but this is a far cry from sufficient to be worth the price. While expecting the restaurant to be of very high quality, it was disappointing to instead find a unremarkable (except in size) meal, and a disappointing venue.</p></body></html>
