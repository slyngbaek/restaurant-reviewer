<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Lotus Asia's Best was quite a let down. I really was not impressed by the food. It was pretty cheap but it wasn't very good. The beer is pretty good there but they have a small selection. Overall the meal was just underwhelming shop some where else in my opinion.</p>
<p>The service at Lotus Asia's Best also wasn't great. I have to say that when we went there it was quite busy but the service took for every to set us. Then it took for ever for a waiter to come to our table. Finally, the food took a while to actually come. Maybe it was just cause it was busy but service seem poor when we went.</p>
<p>Lotus is an extremely standard restaurant. There is nothing really impressive about it except that it has Mongolian barbeque. If I ever go back I will have to try that out.</p>
<p>Overall i would not rate Lotus very well. I was not impressed when I went there. I will probably give it one more chance so I can try the only Mongolian barbecue in San Luis Obispo but I don't have very high hopes for it. I would say try another place if you have the choice.</p></body></html>
