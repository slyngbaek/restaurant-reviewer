<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Margie's main theme is portions. It is like two meals for the price of 3/2. However, they don't sacrafice any quality. They food is great and in large portions. Also, they serve breakfast all day long, so that is a plus.</p>
<p>The service was fine. It was typical diner service. Nice people and quick serivce.</p>
<p>One of the best things about Margie's all of the little saying and easter eggs that they have around. They have a bunch of "No Whining" signs, you can pay like $1 for some guys phone number so you can talk to him, and other things like this.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Overall, it was a great brunch. Great food at a fun place. The food is a little expensive, but I believe that it is expected to have it over two meals. So, then it is pretty normal.</p></body></html>
