All their burgers are amazing and come with a gigantic portion. My favorite burger so far is the Lulu burger. I have tried all of their appetizers and they are all delicious. The riblets they serve are to die for. The appetizers also come in large portions as well! Last but not least, the beer they have on tap is always a great selection. I find myself going to their “Steal the Glass” event every week with my friends to try the new beer they have on tap.<br /><br />Eureka Burger has one of the best servers I’ve ever experienced. They are well knowledged about all their food and even provide good recommendations based on what you want to eat. They are also very knowledgeable on their selection of beer on tap, even to the point of how they are brewed. Although sometimes during rush hour they seem to rush you a bit, they are overall very nice and friendly.<br /><br />Eureka Burger’s venue is definitely above average. They have two floors with a lounging area to eat and drink on the second floor. The railings on the second floor use glass so it adds a nice atmosphere up there. The first floor is a very general eating area but they also use benches as chairs which is pretty unique. Their bar area is awesome and is always clean looking. Their display of taps is really nice.<br /><br />Overall, Eureka Burger is one of my favorite places to eat in San Luis Obispo. Their food is amazing and, combined with their service, makes it an enjoyable experience to eat there every time. Their specials and happy hour also provide great deals and an incentive to go eat there. The atmosphere is really friendly and my friends and I really enjoy it. I would recommend this place to anyone who asks about it.<strong><br /></strong></p></body></html>
