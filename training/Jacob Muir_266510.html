<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>La Costa is a Mexican Restaurant on the east side of San Jose.  It resembles what some might refer to as a “little hole in the wall” but that is okay because it serves excellent Mexican food.  Seating at La Costa is outdoors only and small.  One section of the seating does have a canopy that provides shade.  La Costa employees speak both Spanish and English. </p>
<p>La Costa’s prices are extremely cheap and the portions are very large.  The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner.  From burrito camaron to shrimp ceviche to carne asada tacos, La Costa offers a wide variety of Mexican food.  No alcohol is available for purchase.  Attire is very casual and good for small groups and families. The service is very fast and orders are accurate despite being taken at an outdoor window.  The food is authentic and comes out fresh and hot every time.  Prices range from $4.00 to $8.00 for meals, beverage included.</p>
<p>La Costa has street parking and shares a small parking lot with a mechanic’s shop and a mini market.  During peak times, parking can be difficult.  La Costa faces a busy street so the regular flow of traffic can be a distraction.  Since La Costa only provides outdoor seating, weather will dictate one’s choice to visit; however, they do provide take-out orders.</p>
<p>La Costa is a great place to grab some outstanding Mexican food at very inexpensive prices.  If you like eating outdoors and love Mexican food, La Costa is the place.  No reservations are needed.  The outdoor tables are typically kept clean.  Customers tend to pick up after they finish eating, but staff also comes out and wipes down the tables and sweeps.  La Costa provides home cooked meals without the mess.    </p></body></html>
