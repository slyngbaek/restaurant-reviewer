<p><br />WRITTEN REVIEW:<br /><br />The pizza at Woodstocks is excellent. It comes greasy and delicious! I tried 3 different pizzas here with my friends on a Friday night: the hawiian; the carnivore; and a bbq chicken pizza. All of them were good and just out of the oven. Of all pizza places in San Luis Obispo, this one definitely has the tastiest pizza. <br /><br />The service at Woodstocks is pretty good. We were going to get our pizzas “To Go” since we weren’t sure if we were staying, but after we found a table, we asked a woman who worked there if we could change it for here. She was very helpful and had them change our order. She even brought the pizzas out to us and very kindly went to get us a serving utensil even though we could have gotten it ourselves. The staff is nice and really helpful. <br /><br />Woodstocks has that after-sports-game pizza party sort of feel, with lots of TVs and old tables. They also have video games and a Pac-Man table which is pretty cool. But the place is really crowded. Normally it can be very difficult to get a seat here, but we lucked out because it was earlier in the day. The tables aren’t the cleanest and there isn’t much room to walk around the tables, so you have to awkwardly scoot in your chair often. The atmosphere is nice otherwise, and everyone seem to be enjoying themselves. <br /><br />Overall, I think this is one of the best pizza places in SLO. There are always tons of coupons for the place too and the pizza is good. A lot of people come here to hang out and drink beer and the place has weekly trivia nights and pint nights. Woodstocks is in the heart of downtown and has become a real landmark for those visiting. I think it’s a great place; I would go here again. <br /><strong><br /></strong></p></body></html>
