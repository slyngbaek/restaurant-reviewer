The menu is simple and to the point: a couple variations on the basic “char burger” (the star of the show), sandwiches, salads, and drinks -- all reasonably priced. The char burger is on par with the best of the popular chain eateries, and is a solid choice if you’re downtown and looking for a quick bite.<br /><br />Being a “new kid on the block”, The Habit has an all-new, clean, and comfortably modern-industrial interior, and a cheerful crew of workers to go along with it. Ordering was quick and pleasant, with the cashier making a point of asking me “how are you,” which was a nice touch. The staff uses vibrating wireless “pucks” to notify customers that their food is ready, which substitutes the typical order number call-outs for a more peaceful dining experience. The portions are on the smaller side, but the food is good quality and fairly cheap -- for mid-range burgers, at least.<br /><br />What surprised me the most, though, was the service: the staff seem to be adamantly obiding to their employee handbooks. After my friend has finished eating, a worker passing by noticed and offered to take the tray and throw away the trash. While on par for “sit down” restaurants, this was a very unexpected and pleasant gesture from what is mostly a typical burger joint.<br /><br />Overall, The Habit Burger Grill is a solid choice for good quality burgers at reasonable prices, and pleasing service to boot. While the eats are certainly not high-cuisine (what burger is?), they deliver a great bang for you buck. The atmosphere is somewhat sterile, but also as no-frills as the food, in a good way. If you’re in downtown SLO and don’t feel like Firestone, make sure to check out The Habit.<br /><br /></p></body></html>
