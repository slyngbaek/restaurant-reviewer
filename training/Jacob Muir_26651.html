<p><span style="color:#000000;">WRITTEN REVIEW:</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Las Catrinas is a small Mexican restaurant in the Evergreen area of San Jose.  It is located among two dozen shops and businesses in a small outdoor, strip mall.  It is surrounded by homes on one side and a small park on the other.  From its small outdoor seating area, it provides views of the San Jose foothills.   </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Las Catrinas has mainly street parking, but there is a parking lot near the grocery store that was closed down and still resides unoccupied.  The employees of Las Catrinas speak both English and Spanish and the customers who frequent the place are of all nationalities.  Las Catrinas is a restaurant good for kids and groups.  It is casual attire and no reservations are required. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Las Catrinas recently remodeled the inside with fresh paint and art work.  All orders are taken through one register.  If the restaurant is busy, there could be some wait time.  Delivery of the food is generally 10 minutes and is delivered to your table. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">Las Catrinas is a place to get some great Mexican food at an inexpensive price.  The quality of food is outstanding and their choices on the menu are numerous and covers breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Las Catrinas provides ala carte to full blown meals and provides free chips and salsa for dining in customers.  Their salsas are made from scratch. Beer and wine are available for purchase.  Las Catrinas provides take out services.  From a super burrito to a quesadilla to fish tacos, the portions are very generous.  The pricing is very reasonable and runs around $4.75 to $6.50.   </span></p></body></html>
