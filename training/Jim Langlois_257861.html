<p><span>WRITTEN REVIEW:</span></p>
<p><span>The food served at Taco De Mexico falls under the category of authentic Mexican food. They serve a wide variety of Mexican food, such as tacos, burritos, tostadas and many other expected items that would be served in this genre. I really enjoy the food here; it is quite delicious for Mexican food. The ingredients the use to cook tastes better than most other Mexican restaurants in the area for the price. They also have many different types of meats, beans, rice, and other standard ingredients if you do not like a specific ingredient you can get a substitute.</span></p>
<p><span>The service coming into Taco De Mexico is decent; they greeted me and awaited me to order my food. They do seem to be a little more fluent in Spanish than English, which does it make it a little harder to customize an order (leave out ingredients, add ingredients, etc.) but the repeat it to you and seem to try to get your order correct. Once the food was finished, they brought the food over to my table (to-go order) and I left the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span>The venue at the restaurant is okay. The inside of the venue is very small and compact, which makes it difficult when there are multiple parties inside ordering and eating simultaneously. The venue does have an outdoor area, which I would definitely recommend to anyone eating at the restaurant as the inside may not be the best choice to dine in.</span></p>
<p><span>Even with the few short comings, I did really enjoy getting food from Taco De Mexico. Their food is better than most Mexican food in the area and their staff seems to be attentive to the customers wants. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys Mexican food or to anyone who is tired of Chipotle. They are also open most of the day, which is a nice added benefit.</span></p></body></html>
