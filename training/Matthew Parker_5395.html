<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>In-N-Out burger is a standard tradition by this time among California natives and even visitors.  This was hardly the first burger I have ever ordered and not the best (although they are always of high quality).  I went for the regular order (that I always get) the double double animal style with a side of fries.  This time I varied and got a chocolate shake instead of the regular drink.  This animal style burger was uneventful for the most part with the exception of having a tad too much mustard.  I have never been able to taste the mustard in an animal style burger before and this was abnormal.  The fries were good and fresh (as they always are) and the shake slightly above average for shakes.</p>
<p>The service at In-N-Out is about what you would expect from a fast food restaurant.  I give this particular experience a 5 because the service was the fastest I have ever experienced from an In-N-Out burger and certainly faster than the vast majority of fast food experiences I have had.  I had just a few minutes (maybe 1.5) to sit down before my order was announced, much to my astonishment, as well as theirs.  The cashier who took my order as well as delivered it even made a positive remark along the lines of “that was fast”.</p>
<p>I give the venue a two for the reason that there were no booths inside the restaurant at the time that I went.  For that matter there were no permanent tables either.  They had instead white plastic patio furniture set up.  The reason for this was explained to have been the redoing of the tile floor of the building but it was still odd and inconvenient.</p>
<p>Overall, it was an eventful In-N-Out burger stop, by all previous standards.  The lack of furniture and the rapid service made it stand out but overall canceled each other out.  I would definitely not put it as my best experience with the chain, but it was average.  However, In-N-Out is certainly above average relative to its peers gaining it a 4 rating.</p></body></html>
