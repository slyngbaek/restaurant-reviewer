<p>I went to G. Brothers during their happy hour. The tacos are only $1 and delicious. The amount of food you get for the price is awesome.</p>
<p>The service is pretty minimal. The food was prepared quickly and the staff was friendly. The tables are cleaned regularly.</p>
<p>The venue is like most other BBQ restaurants. They have picnic style table cloths. There is plenty of seating. It doesn't seem like anything is missing.</p>
<p>Overall G. Brothers is a great restaurant. The food is cheap and delicious, the service is fine, and the venue is standard for a BBQ restaurant.</p></body></html>
