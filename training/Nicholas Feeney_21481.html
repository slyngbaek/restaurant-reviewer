WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Thai-Rriffic is a sit down Thai food restaurant that has pretty good Thai food. I really like their Pad-Thai. They also have some pretty good Thai beer that I always order whenever I go to Thai-Rriffic. Their food is a little expensive for Thai food however. I went with a group and our dinner and three beers was $66. I think that Thai-Rriffic is worth the price however.</p>
<p>Thai-Rriffic has pretty good service. There aren't many people that go to Thai-Rriffic during the week so it is usually easy to find a place to sit and the service is usually prompt. The waiters can have some pretty thick accents but that is what makes it interesting.</p>
<p>Thai-Rriffic is a kind of small but there always seems to be plenty of room whenever I am there. It is a small restaurant that supports about 15 tables so it is can be a little squished if it is really busy. Thai-Rriffic has it's own parking lot so it is always easy to find parking.</p>
<p>Overall I would give Thai-Rriffic a thumbs up cause it is pretty good thai food and not too expensive. I believe it to be one of the best places that you can get thai food in San Luis Obispo. Also the coffee after dinner mints are awsome.</p></body></html>
