<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Mei's Chinese Restaurant (Mei's) has a familiar Chinese restaurant feel. The food on the menu is almost all familiar with a few chef's specials near the front. These menu items are better than the stock items; the standard Chinese fair is not terribly impressive, but adequately represents Americanized Chinese restaurant food. The Honey Chicken--deep fried bits of chicken lathered in a honey glaze--is excellent, though a safe choice. Mei's food is certainly not adventurous. The item I ordered as spicy had absolutely no spice, though this could be to blame on sensitive individuals who had dined before me.</p>
<p>Service at Mei's was quick and minimal. The server became frustrated with me when I she misheard my order even though I stated it correctly. The employees have only minimal English knowledge, but it is more than enough to get by. I never felt that my business was appreciated, but I also prefer minimal server contact.</p>
<p>There was little about Mei's venue that stands out amoung other Chinese establishments. While the atmosphere is familiar, it lacks any unique characteristics. I noticed how quiet it was when we walked in. While I usually enjoy a quiet restaurant, this felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable. Mei's is accomidating for large groups and parking is easy. From San Luis Obispo the drive to Mei's is 10 minutes, but there is not very man options for Chinese food in San Luis Obispo.</p>
<p>Mei's is a safe choice for unoffensive Chinese food. Though I wouldn't say Mei's shines, I will ultimately return to satiate my Chinese craving. The food is familiar and showcases a few unique gems. There is no service to brag about. The waiter became easily frustrated and somewhat alienating, but the food was punctual. The bland venue left the most to be desired.</p></body></html>
