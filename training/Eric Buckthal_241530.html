<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Lotus Asia's Best boasts it's Vientmaese pho and banh mi sandwiches. I was offended by the pho they served because it was cold and accompanied by wilting, sad bean sprouts and cilantro. The thinly sliced meat in the pho was barely lukewarm and too raw to consume. On my first visit, I chose the ala carte Mongolian eatery style meal and it was better, but overpriced. The pho was inedible; and of course Lotus overcharges for "exotic" cuisine.</p>
<p>There isn't much service to mention. I brought a couple friends on this visit and our waiter didn't quite get our drink order correctly, but it wasn't a big deal. The waiter was curt and polite, but he wouldn't bring out better vegetables after the first looked horrible. I'm not much to cause a scene especially in front of my friends so I decided to just never go back to this establishment and bite the bullet this time.</p>
<p>The venue stands well on its own. The outdoor seating is nice and with all this weather we have in San Luis Obispo, it's easy to eat outside most days of the year. Indoors isn't quite as nice. The flourescent lighting and TV's take away from the half-romantic environment. There is a dividing wall that separates the indoor dining where I ate on one occasion that secludes diners, but also left us feeling unattended. It was difficult to find waiters because they could easily avoid the side room.</p>
<p>Lotus also has a great location. It's set aside in the quite part of town near the train station. There was several small restaraunts in the area and it's a nice place to hang out on a warm day. There is adequate, free parking because this section of town is set apart from the real downtown San Luis Obispo. The outdoor seating at Lotus is it's best feature, but it's consistently ruined by loud pop music. I don't mind unobtrusive music, but I certainly couldn't ignore it here. They serve the only pho in San Luis Obispo I'm aware of, but that certainly isn't an excuse to make the trip. You're best to setting for some of the delicious Thai or noodle options in San Luis Obispo.</p></body></html>
