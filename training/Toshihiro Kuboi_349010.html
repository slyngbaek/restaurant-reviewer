<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Ciao only offers pizza and salad. To be honest, the food sucks. On the menu three kinds of pizza are listed but most of the time it has only pepperloni and vegetarian pizza. Moreover, the salad is not fresh. But, I go there because there is no other choice. Ciao is the only place on campus which is open on weekends.</p>
<p>I can not expect more from a place like Ciao. Only complaint I have is that there is almost always a line of people waiting for the food which is not worth waiting for. It should staff more people at the casher.</p>
<p>Ciao as a venue is ok. It is spacious and I can always find a seat. Ciao is only place which is open on weekends on campus. Without Ciao I am going to starve. <br /> <br />Overall, Ciao is not an ideal place to dine. It is a place for a snack. Only reason I go there is because no other place is open on weekends.</p>
