<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>SUMO SUSHI offers sushi and other Japanese dishes as its name suggests. I did not expect to have good Japanese food there but to my surprise the food was good. I had Alaskan Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll and Salmon Egg sushi. The Alaskan Roll was very good. It is a roll of rice wrapped by raw salmon. The salmon was soft and tasty. The salmon egg sushi tasted just as I expected. I marked one point off because the spicy tuna roll was not what I expected: It was spiced by Jalapeno instead of Wasabi.</p>
<p>The service I got at SUMO SUSHI was OK, but I felt that its ordering system was bit strange: I ordered sushi to a waitress but she told me to tell the order to one of the chefs who were cooking sushi behind the counter. But to order other things like beer, I had to tell a waiter not the chefs. I witnessed a strange thing there: A guy who was sitting close to me said "two more beers" to a chef and the chef replied, "No thanks. I am drinking water." The guy shook his head and told the order instead to a waiter who was standing nearby.</p>
<p>Although its entrance looks shoddy, SUMO SUSHI is spacious inside and can seat many people. It has many tables for groups of many people and many seats for 1 person or two people at a long counter. I marked one point off because its entrance looks shoddy.</p>
<p>Overall, SUMO SUSHI is a good restaurant. Although it does not offer real Japanese food, it is a good place to eat sea food cooked in Americanized Japanese style.</p>
