<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Lotus features a Mongolian bbq that allows one to build their own stir fry meal. It has a selection of multiple meats such as pork, chicken, and beef. It also has a decent selection of vegetables, rice’s, and extras such as noodles that can be added to the bowl. The food compares quite well compared to other build it yourself stir fry’s. The restaurant features other Mongolian food, though I am not familiar with it. I recommend Lotus for its stir fry. They also have table tappers for those wanting to celebrate an occasion.</p>
<p>Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted by an attended that quickly seated us, allowing us to choose whether we would like to eat inside and outside. They were quick to get us our drinks and take our orders. Once they got our stir fry, they immediately started cooking it – allowing us to watch them make it if we so desire. The staff was very friendly and attentive during the entire visit.</p>
<p>Lotus has an Asian modern style to the venue. It has both outdoors and indoors. Outside has an Asian style lighting with heaters for if it is cold. Inside has Asian style paint/wallpaper that works well. The restaurant is clean and allows for the customers to see their food being prepared, which is fun. There was also music playing the entire time, and it happened to an album from one of my favorite bands, which was definitely a plus – they obviously hand pick their music and do not play the old repeating radio stations.</p>
<p>Lotus is one of my favorite restaurants, and they have been consistently been as described as above. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone whom enjoys stir fry and a pleasant atmosphere. They have other food as well, but I have no experimented too much outside the stir fry but I bet it is just as good. Lotus is a high class restaurant for a decent price.</p></body></html>
