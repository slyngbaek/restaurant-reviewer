<p>REVIEWER: Joseph White <br /><br />NAME: Linnaea's Cafe <br /><br />ADDRESS: 1110 Garden Street <br /><br />CITY: San Luis Obispo <br /><br />FOOD: 4 <br /><br />SERVICE: 5 <br /><br />VENUE: 5 <br /><br />OVERALL: 5 <br /><br />WRITTEN REVIEW: <br /><br />Linnaea's has some of the best coffee around San Luis Obispo. Their espresso is <br />my favorite around town, and their pastries are usually top-notch. They have an <br />amazing rhubarb tart that is my usually my first choice; however, they were out <br /> so I had a brownie, which wasn't too bad. <br /><br />The service was very good. The staff was very friendly, and was quick to <br />make my drink. There was also a very cool design in the foam of my cappuccino <br />which showed that the barista had great attention to detail. <br /><br />Linnaea's is a great place to hang out and talk with friends. The inside <br />seating of the cafe was pretty crowded, but it was a nice day, so sitting <br />outside was fine. There is a nice seating area in the back, with lots of plants <br />and shade: very comfortable. <br /><br />Linnaea's is one of the best cafes in town. It's small, has great coffee, and <br />makes you feel like you're right at home. It's also right in the middle of <br />downtown SLO, so it's usually a quick walk from shopping and other restaurants.</p></body></html>
