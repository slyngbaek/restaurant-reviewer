<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Mee Heng Low is a noodle house with a vague resemblance to Chinese noodles. Mee<br />Heng Low offers four primary options of noodles and several meat options. Of<br />the noodle options there is chow mein, low mein, soup, and some other option.<br />The meat options included chicken, beef, shrimp, and some others. The food was<br />decent. The noodles were done well, though not served hot. The vegetables were<br />a nice consistency, not cooked too long but cooked enough that they clearly<br />were not raw. The saving grace of the meal overall was the subtle yet sweet<br />taste of the sweet plum sauce. However, this was not nearly what I expected (I<br />expected a sauce more similar to Hoisin plum sauce) and so while I accepted<br />that the food was not bad, it was still something of a disappointment.</p>
<p>The service at Mee Heng Low was standard. Once my order was placed and the food<br />was finished cooking, it was brought to me at my table. However, my water was<br />refilled in a relatively timely manner. I think our server went a step above<br />when he explained why a customer that had ordered his food after me received<br />his food before me. I feel like it could go either way, the server could have<br />easily carried on without mentioning to me why my food was slower in getting to<br />my table. I appreciate that he explained it and I think that deserved a bump in<br />Mee Heng Low's otherwise average score.</p>
<p>Mee Heng Low had a very casual, cozy atmosphere to it. It felt like an urban<br />building -- some pipes exposed and the walls made of brick. I liked the<br />ambience that the decorations had to offer, and I very much enjoy the<br />atmosphere that Mee Heng Low has managed to establish in their building.</p>
<p>Overall, I think Mee Heng Low was a relatively average experience, with bonus<br />points for the atmosphere and quality of our server. I would not go to Mee Heng<br />Low very often, but it is certainly a place that I wouldn't mind going to<br />every now and then, possibly even suggest going to.</p>
