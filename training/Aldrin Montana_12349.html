<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Mee Heng Low is a noodle house with a vague resemblance to Chinese noodles. Mee<br />Heng Low offers four primary options of noodles and several meat options. Of<br />the noodle options there is chow mein, low mein, soup, and some other option.<br />The meat options included chicken, beef, shrimp, and some others. The food was<br />decent. The noodles were done well, though not served hot. The vegetables were<br />a nice consistency, not cooked too long but cooked enough that they clearly<br />were not raw. The saving grace of the meal overall was the subtle yet sweet<br />taste of the sweet plum sauce. However, this was not nearly what I expected (I<br />expected a sauce more similar to Hoisin plum sauce) and so while I accepted<br />that the food was not bad, it was still something of a disappointment.</p>
<p>The service at Mee Heng Low was standard. Once my order was placed and the food<br />was finished cooking, it was brought to me at my table. However, my water was<br />refilled in a relatively timely manner. I think our server went a step above<br />when he explained why a customer that had ordered his food after me received<br />his food before me. I feel like it could go either way, the server could have<br />easily carried on without mentioning to me why my food was slower in getting to<br />my table. I appreciate that he explained it and I think that deserved a bump in<br />Mee Heng Low's otherwise average score.</p>
<p>Mee Heng Low had a very casual, cozy atmosphere to it. It felt like an urban<br />building -- some pipes exposed and the walls made of brick. I liked the<br />ambience that the decorations had to offer, and I very much enjoy the<br />atmosphere that Mee Heng Low has managed to establish in their building.</p>
<p>Overall, I think Mee Heng Low was a relatively average experience, with bonus<br />points for the atmosphere and quality of our server. I would not go to Mee Heng<br />Low very often, but it is certainly a place that I wouldn't mind going to<br />every now and then, possibly even suggest going to.</p>

<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Upper Crust Trattoria is an italian restaurant in San Luis Obispo. The food has<br />several very good qualities: very good taste (especially the soup), abundant<br />bread (unlimited actually), and good proportions. Although I may have ate more<br />bread than the average bear, I think that the size of the proportions leave you<br />satisfied and if necessary the bread is unlimited. Additionally, the bread goes<br />marvelously well both with the pasta sauce and the soup broth. The soup broth<br />had a very noticeable taste but not particularly overwhelming. The only problem<br />I had with the food was that the pasta itself was not particularly flavored,<br />but the meat (I had chicken marsala) tasted so absolutely wonderful it more<br />than made up for the lack of succulence in the pasta.</p>
<p>The service at Upper Crust was also very good. If my waiter was walking by the<br />table, we were sure to be asked how our food tasted and if we had any needs.<br />The servers were also nice, appropriately talkative, and quick to smile.</p>
<p>Upper Crust had a definite atmosphere of elegance established. Much of the<br />furniture was made of some sort of wood, or made to look like wood, and the<br />lighting was dim and warm. We had been placed in front of a fireplace (though<br />not lit) that even gave the restaurant a sort of cozy at home feel.<br />Additionally there was an awesome drunk guy that tried his hand at chatting<br />with some ladies that was particularly amusing.</p>
<p>Overall, Upper Crust far exceeded my expectations. From the outside appearance<br />and the name I wasn't sure if the place was just a fancy pizza place beyond the<br />likes of California Pizza Kitchen. To my surprise, Upper Crust was a very great<br />tasting italian restaurant with quite a bit of style and personality. I would<br />highly recommend Upper Crust to anyone and everyone (though it's expensive).</p>

<p>Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is a BBQ restaurant that primarily serves burgers, BBQ<br />ribs, BBQ chicken, and various sandwiches. The selection was not terribly<br />diverse, but they had 'Killer Garlic Fries' which were sure to be a great hit.<br />Sure enough, their BBQ tastes quite good and their garlic fries lived up to my<br />expectations of garlic-ness. Although, thinking back on it, it wasn't<br />particularly memorable, so despite it being good and me quite enjoying it, I<br />wonder if it wasn't exceptional, hence the 4.</p>
<p>Service at Moe's smokehouse was wonderful, at least as far as BBQ grill<br />restaurants go. It didn't necessarily have the typical male server or register<br />worker that really gives BBQ or bar and grill restaurants a feel of ruggedness.<br />However, the servers were quick to bring us our food, and despite not expecting<br />any service they even asked if we needed anything a couple times. I think as<br />far as BBQ restaurants goes Moe's, at least today, had quite good service.</p>
<p>Moe's atmosphere was quite typical: A walk up register where you order, a soda<br />fountain, and a look and feel very similar to most BBQ restaurants I've been<br />to. Although, that being said, I also didn't pay much attention to any of their<br />pictures and artwork. I may have missed out on the appeal of the restaurant<br />itself but I didn't think there is anything I would consider memorable<br />decorating their walls.</p>
<p>Moe's Smokehouse BBQ is exactly what you would expect, plus bonus taste and<br />service. I think it is definitely a good place to go every once in awhile. Of<br />course, being a BBQ restaurant it shouldn't be frequented too often, but the<br />price is affordable for a fair amount of food (including a lot of fries) and<br />the overall experience is quite comforting.</p></body></html>
