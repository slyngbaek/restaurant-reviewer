<p class="p1">WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p class="p1">Wahoo's Fish Taco offers an assortment of cali-mex food with a wide variety of meat an fish choices for your filling. The food is great quality and reasonably priced. Their carne asada was a bit dry but their shrimp was to die for. Certainly the best shrimp tacos I've ever had.</p>
<p class="p1">The service at Wahoo's, is in a fast-food style. You order your food at the front, then find a table to sit at with your number. Your food is then brought to your table when it is ready. Service is prompt and the cashiers are happy to give you more napkins or sauce.</p>
<p class="p1">The venue is located on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara. The restaurant has skate boarding / surfer feel with numerous boards around the shop and stickers littering the walls. TVs on the walls are showing surfing videos and a good assortment of music is being played. Altogether a fun and relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<p class="p1">Overall, Wahoo's provides some great cali-mex food if you are driving through Santa Barbara. The venue is centrally located and fits well in a beach town. I definitely recommend driving through and grabbing some shrimp tacos.</p></body></html>
