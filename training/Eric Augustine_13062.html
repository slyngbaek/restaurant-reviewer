<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>The food was pretty good for the price (about $10). Nothing too extraordinary, but decent. The portions were fine.</p>
<p>The service was great. There was only one guy, but he was very friendly and generally on top of things. He got my order wrong, but I was being a bit confusing. He refilled out water immediatly, and was vert nice. He greeted us when we came in, and said farewell when we left.</p>
<p>The venue was pretty nice. It was pretty small, but very cozy. There was some nice background music. The place looked cool and there was a good atmospherre. Some cool nik-nacks around. </p>
<p>Overall, the experiece was nice. The sole server even mentioned that he was the only one there at the time we went (3pm on Saturday). Depite that, he handled us very well. It would probably be even better at a more popular time. However, there was one glaring problem. There was NO FORTUNE IN MY COOKIE.</p>
