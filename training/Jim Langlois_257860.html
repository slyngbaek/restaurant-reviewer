<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Outback Steakhouse has a large range of food choices. Their biggest feature is their steaks, as the name of the restaurant would imply. There have the typical steaks, and some house specialty steaks. They also have a wide range of steak toppings that flavor up the steak even more. They also have many drinks to choose from. I love steaks, and outback steakhouse performs very well at making their steaks delicious. I have eaten multiple steaks in the past at this restaurant. Their proportions are also very generous. My only markdown is the fact that they are a bit on the pricey side, though I have seen worse.</p>
<p>The service at Outback Steakhouse was great and as expected from a more expensive restaurant. We put our names down (with a reservation) and got a buzzer to alarm us when we were ready to be seated. We came on Saturday night and expected the wait to be long, but that was not the case; we only had to wait 10-15 minutes before being seated. The server did a good job at making sure our visit was pleasant. The server helped us out by looking up a balance on a gift card for us to help us decide how much we were going to spend (200$ gift card opened up some options for one night).</p>
<p>The venue at Outback Steakhouse was also very good. The building was modern and looked fairly new. The entire restaurant was clean from what I could tell. Inside was very spacey and their seating was also incredibly spacious. I felt like there was plenty of room even with a semi-large party of six people. The lighting inside was also appropriate. The bathrooms were clean and large enough to support multiple customers at once.</p>
<p>Outback Steakhouse is a great choice for a great steak. They have a good atmosphere and a staff that will take care of your needs. The only downside (and reason I may not recommend it) is the fact the most of their dinner foods are pricey, so if you are on a budget it may not be the restaurant for you. All of their steaks are cooked to perfection and you will leave full. Other Outback Steakhouses offer similar experiences. </p></body></html>
