<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Taj Palace is a nice Indian restaurant conveniently situated fairly close to campus, on Foothill and Broad.  The restaurant is family owned and operated, and offers a delightful variety of classic Indian food stuffs.</p>
<p>The food at Taj Palace always leaves me coming back for more.  During lunch and on Monday nights, they have a buffet filled with the classics: daal, saag paneer, tikki masala, tandoori chicken, the works.  All served with superbly fresh naan hot out of the oven.  I always eat so much that my stomach aches for hours afterwards!</p>
<p>The service is as good as you could hope for a buffet.  The owner is always attentive, as I’m always very thirsty when I come in, and he is always stopping by every couple minutes to joke that I have a hollow leg and continuously fills my cup.  The employees greet you with smiling faces, and enjoy seeing people enjoy their food.</p>
<p>The venue is nothing much, but it’s as good as it needs to be.  Simple tables and chairs, nothing fancy.  A small buffet area offers all the goodness you could hope for.  There are no extravagancies or fanciness, just a place to serve great food.</p>

<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Mondeo Pronto is a fusion restaurant located in the middle of downtown San Luis Obispo.  It features a mix of Mediterranean and Asian dishes.  They have a few homemade drinks: their ginger ale is exceptionally popular.</p>
<p>The food at Mondeos is ok.  I had the ahi wasabi bowl, which is apparently a SLO favorite.  I found the ahi to be rather flavorless compared to seared ahi at several other places, and this depressing bit of new was covered by a flurry of vegetables and sauces that just didn’t seem to go together.  There was a nice wasabi sauce, and I was very confused when I dug in to find a rice ball buried in the dish covered in a sweet teriyaki-like sauce.  I felt that neither complimented the tuna well.  The ginger ale, another local favorite, didn’t have the kick I’ve come to expect from homemade ginger ales, and was a bit of a let down.</p>
<p>There wasn’t much to say about the service.  They greeted you nicely enough when you went to the counter to order, but apart from bringing out the food, they didn’t do much.  The person taking my order seemed not to know certain things about the menu that I would expect them to know.</p>
<p>The venue is probably the best part of this restaurant.  It is situated directly next to Barnes and Noble, and opens into the shopping area.  The walls are covered with hanging plants, wicker baskets, and mirrors, so it’s nice enough to look at.  I wish the food quality matched the décor.</p></body></html>
