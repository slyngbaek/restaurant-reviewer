<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Melo’s is a pizza and pasta restaurant. The pizza I ordered was amazing. The price of the pizza was also excellent.</p>
<p>Melo’s normally has excellent service, but this time I had a lousy experience because of the waitress serving my table. First, we had to ask several times for plates. Second, I ordered Diet Pepsi but after the waitress refilled my glass she gave me regular Pepsi. Lastly, the waitress took forever to bring us our check.</p>
<p>Melo’s has plenty of parking. Inside Melo’s there are plenty of tables to sit at. There are several televisions inside on different sports channels.</p>
<p>Melo’s is an amazing sit-down pizza place. It offers great food at a great price at a location that is easy to get to. Unfortunately, service can very drastically depending on what waitress you get.</p></body></html>
