<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Firestone Grill is a sports bar and grill located in downtown San Luis Obispo. Firestone Grill is near many other restaurants such as Woodstock's Pizza and Moe's BBQ. Firestone Grill serves many different dishes, but most of them are BBQ dishes. Firestone Grill primarily serves burgers and tri-trip sandwiches to its customers. In addition to the food, Firestone Grill also serves as a social hangout for many people, especially students. With many TVs, food, and alcohol, it isn't hard to see why.</p>
<p>The food at Firestone Grill is excellent. They are widely known for their tri-tip sandwiches, but their burgers and fries are also delicious. Although the price of the food at Firestone has increased recently, the quality of the food still outweighs the cost. However, compared to other casual food establishments downtown, Firestone isn't cheap (although it isn't really expensive either). In addition to making its own signature <br />food dishes, Firestone also makes its own barbeque sauce.</p>
<p>Firestone Grill is usually extremely busy during the evening, so sometimes the service isn't that great. Wait times to get your order can be long and sometimes order numbers are not called out clearly. On the other hand, tables are usually cleaned quickly and the cashiers do their best to speed up the line. All of the employees are very nice and try to solve any problems that arise. Overall, interacting with Firestone employees is always a pleasant experience.Â </p>
<p>Firestone Grill is definitely not a venue for those who like a nice quiet meal. There are several large TVs in the venue which almost always have sports on them. In addition, the people are constantly talking and it is sometimes hard to hear the other people in your party. Luckily, Firestone Grill also has an outdoor eating area (which is heated during cold days) which is typically much quieter. The chairs and tables aren't terribly confortable (especially outside), which can be a disappointment for some people. Surprisingly, Firestone is usually pretty clean, despite the number of people coming and going to the restaurant. For people who want to have a good meal and watch the game, Firestone is a perfect fit.</p></body></html>
