<p>Kona's makes massive sub sandwiches. I usually have to eat the sandwich for two different meals. The amount of food you get for the price is awesome. Their hawaiian bread makes their sandwich very unique.</p>
<p>The deli makes their sandwiches assembly line style. The employees have definitely know what they are doing so long lines move quickly. The cashiers are usually pretty friendly. Today they offered me water when I didn't even ask for some.</p>
<p>The venue's theme goes with their overall hawaiian business theme. The deli is very clean and organized to accommodate many people. The air conditioning is nice on a hot day.</p>
<p>In general I'd say Kona's is one of my go to delis in the San Luis Obispo area. The sandwich quality its great and consistent. I like that they are a local business and that they provide a great value.</p></body></html>
