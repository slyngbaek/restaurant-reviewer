<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>The South Pine Cafe is a local restraurants to the Nevada County area that serves a wide variety of foods from breakfast to lunch. The restaurant caters to those who want the classic pancakes or biscuits and gravy, but as provides vegan dishes as well. The food wasn't bad, but the prices were relatively expensive and the protions were less than expected -- a carne asada burrito with a side costs $11.75. They also have bar seating and actually serve beer.</p>
<p>The service was the worst part. I went with some friends on a Saturday morning and it took us 10 minutes to for a waitress to seat us even though there were several tables free. With that aside, the waitress was very awkward when taking our orders making it very uncomfortable. Additionally, she didn't come around very frequently to refill our waters or check up on how our food was. Also, the waitress didn't get one of our orders right. Maybe she was new because it wasn't very busy.</p>
<p>The South Pine Cafe in Grass Valley is tucked away behind downtown. You have to find public parking on the street, which isn't too hard. The restaurant was very spacious and well lit with lots of natural sunlight. The seating consists of an array of wooden tables and chairs. The wooden chairs were slightly uncomfortable. Also, the place has wood floors and is very spacious which made it kind of noisy.</p>
<p>Overall, the South Pine Cafe food was average and the service was below average. Since the restaurant is a local cafe, I expected it to be more welcoming and comfortable. The expensive food was expected, but the smaller food portions and average taste was not. With a very spacious environment, the South Pine Cafe welcomes parties of all sizes and tastes whether you'd like your Pancakes or Pesto Mushroom dishes.</p></body></html>
