<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Taco Bell is a Tex-Mex restaurant franchise. The food at Taco Bell is cheap, but delicious. This particular Taco Bell always seems to be busiest after 9PM on weekends.</p>
<p>Although the food at Taco Bell is cheap, the quality of the food is acceptable. It provides a high taste-to-cost ratio and can provide enough food to make even the hungriest person feel full. Admittedly, Taco Bell isn't on my list of restaurants I normally frequent, but if you're in the right mood, it can be fantastic. As with all fast food, Taco Bell is terrible for you and I wouldn't recommend that anyone eats there often.</p>
<p>For a fast food restaurant, Taco Bell drops the ball with their service. Almost every time that I have been there, my order has been incorrect; my most recent visit was no exception. Although there were many customers during my visit, it still shouldn't be that hard to make three tacos. When informed that the order was incorrect, the staff were very gracious and immediately corrected my order. However, this is a very consistent problem that should have been avoided in the first place.</p>
<p>Within the last year or so, Taco Bell has remodeled the restaurant which has made the venue much more pleasant. Despite the large number of customers, there always seems to be enough seating. Most of the tables are clean, but given the volume of customers, this is not unexpected. The venue location is extremely convenient. The venue is on the way back from downtown and close to the freeway entrance. In addition to the physical appearance, the layout of the tables, ordering area, and soda fountains is excellent; there usually isn't any congestion.</p></body></html>
