WRITTEN REVIEW:<br />
The food at Eureka is always delicious. I have tried quite a few of their burgers and have never been dissapointed. They also have some of the best french fries downtown. The only reason they did not receive a five star rating this time was because their 'Maui Wowie' burger skimped on the pineapple.
<br />I was very impressed by the service at Eureka Burger. Our waitress was really nice and handled our large group well. She was also very cute. Our food came out quick, even though we had 20 people.
<br />Eureka Burger is a fun place to go out on a Friday night. It was pretty crowded and they have a lot of tables, so it gets a bit too loud inside. They have a ton of beers on tap of all different varieties.
<br />Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Eureka Burger. The food is good, the beer is good, and the staff is super friendly. I would recommend Eureka Burger for anyone looking for a fun place to meet with friends before a night out.</p></body></html>
