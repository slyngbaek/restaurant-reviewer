<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>IHOP is a breakfast food restaurant similar to Denny’s. IHOP has cheap food of questionable ingredients. The omelet I ordered was mostly meat and barely any egg.</p>
<p>IHOP had mediocre service. The waiter was preoccupied and took a long time to get us our drinks, food and receipts.</p>
<p>IHOP has an alright location. There were plenty of tables inside to sit at though. Unfortunately, the table we sat at was gross. It had been barely cleaned with bits of leftover food on the table still.</p>
<p>IDOP is a sit-down breakfast restaurant. The food is cheap. The staff is mediocre and when I went the table I sat at had food crumbs all over on it.</p></body></html>
