It might be because I’m hungry, but I always crave Taco Bell and not Jack In The Box or McDonalds when it’s late at night. The food tastes good and always fills me up for the price I pay. I especially enjoy the chalupas they offer. They also have an exclusive Mountain Dew soda flavor that I always get. Although Taco Bell is not authentic Mexican food, they still try to preserve the Mexican flavors. For a fast food place, they do a pretty good job. The only other Americanized Mexican food I would pick over Taco Bell is Chipotle.<br /><br />Since Taco Bell is a fast food place, there isn’t really much to say about service. I rated service based on the speed of which my order came. My food came out pretty slow, but it was also relatively quick since there were many people in the restaurant and in line.<br /><br />The venue isn’t all that special compared to other fast food restaurants I have been in. There really is no decorations for the venue. They way they set up the isles was also pretty poor since the line wrapped around the restaurant with two entrances cutting between them. People had to go all around the restaurant just to get in line. In my opinion, the old venue before they remodeled was better.<br /><br />Overall, Taco bell is an average fast food restaurant. Their food tastes good but not as good as other top-rated fast food restaurants. The service was relatively quick, but there was still a lot of downtime waiting for my food. The venue could definitely be improved to accommodate longer lines, especially since they’re open late and attract intoxicated people. I would still prefer places like In N Out or Five Guys, but Taco Bell  </p></body></html>
