<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Black Horse serves excellent espresso and decent pastries. I ordered a cappuccino along with a strawberry-rhubarb muffin. The cappuccino was quite good, and had lots of fluffy foam atop the drink. The muffin was just alright. It was a nice snack while sipping my coffee, but did not have a ton of flavor and was a bit pricey - although it was a large muffin which was nice.</p>
<p>The service was very good. The cashier that took my drink order was friendly and helpful, providing information about some drinks before I ordered, as well as being sure to clarify if I needed a plate for my muffin. The drink was also made rather quickly.</p>
<p>Black Horse is in a nice, fairly-average coffee shop. Several small tables are scattered around which sets a nice tone, but at the same time makes it easy to imagine it frequently full and without available seating. There are some interesting decorations around the shop that provide some nice things to look at while enjoying your drink. As a personal preference, when staying at a coffee shop for awhile, I like to enjoy my drink in a mug rather than a paper cup which didn't seem to be an option.</p>
<p>Black Horse is a very nice coffee shop that is a great place to grab a quick drink or stay to enjoy it for awhile. It is less unique than some of the other coffee shops in downtown San Luis Obispo, but serves as a more polished option.</p></body></html>
