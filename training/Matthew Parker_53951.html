<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Having only gone to Frank's for the first time last week, I can already say I have become somewhat of a regular having gone 3 times already. The reason for this is mostly the food. Although it's not spectacular, the grub is cheep and gets the job done. This last time was disappointing with the reason being that the bun on my polish dog was on the verge of disintegration. Despite this the food was of ok quality and tasty but not great.</span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">The service was ridiculously fast today. It seemed like I had barely sat down before the food was delivered to my table. This and the fact that the servers are always helpful earns it a good score. The restaurant is more fast food than anything else and should be considered based on this standard.</span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">The venue is what I like most about franks. It really has a local feel, if you know what I mean. They have pictures of the building from the 50's on the wall and it is always filled with locals (unlike many of the other fast food restaurants and upscale places in San Luis). It really feels attached to the community.</span></span></p>

<p align="left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Overall Frank's is pretty good. I like the food and the cheap ready availability. Unfortunately, this last pass was not the greatest experience I have had there. For the first time I got the extra large drink. The reason behind this is that last time I got a large and it was far too small. The extra large is way too large. This is just a small issue though.</span></span></p></body></html>
