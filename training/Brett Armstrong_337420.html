The food there is always good and I really like their french fries. They also have really tasty salads and any of them can be turned into a wrap which is even better.<br />The service at Pappy McGregors is usually pretty good. Most of the servers there are very nice, but unfortunately on our most recent trip, this was not the case. Our server was not friendly or attentive. She was also kind of rude about splitting up the bill across multiple credit cards, since no one had cash.<br />Pappy McGregors is kind of a strange venue. It was a busy Friday night, so we were seated at an upstairs table. They do not have many tables upstairs, which was nice because it was more private, but the table was awkwardly stuck between ceiling supports that interfered with the seating. They have a very nice fire pit outside, but there is such limited seating out there it is hard to take advantage of it.<br />Overall, Pappy McGregors has decent food and a nice enough atmosphere. However, it does not offer anything that other restaurants downtown do not already have, and its location is not very good. While it is definitely worth checking out, I will probably just go downtown next time.</p></body></html>
