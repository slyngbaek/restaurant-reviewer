<p>WRITTEN REVIEW:</p>
<p>Firestone Grill serves many different types of sandwiches, burgers, and salads.  Their tri-tip sandwiches are their delicacy, served with more than enough meat to satisfy your average meat lover.  Also, if you like pork, they have a delicious Pig Sandwich filled with shredded (or maybe pulled) pork which tastes superb.  Firestone also provides vegetarian options including salads and garden burgers.  Lastly, for those who like a nice beer to go along with a great sandwich, Firestone has got that too.</p>
<p>On the weekends and some nights, Firestone can get pretty busy with the line extending out the door.  If you can wait 20 to 30 minutes for your, you won't regret it.  Considering how many customers they push through the line, the service is really great.  They have several cash registers taking customers order and making the line go fairly quickly.  And since their sandwiches are quite simple, it doesn't take much time after you make your order.  Another great thing about this place is that they don't charge you extra for a side or two of ranch or barbeque sauce.  </p>
<p>Firestone Grill is located in downtown San Luis Obispo, which is a prime location for eating, shopping, playing at the Apple store, and getting some frozen yogurt.  The restaurant has indoor and patio seating.  They also have several large flat-screen TVs with the latest games on for all those sports lovers.  This place is clean, spacious, and welcoming.</p>
<p>Overall, Firestone Grill is a gem in San Luis Obispo.  If you like barbeque, you'll love this place.  The prices are reasonable and the food is high quality.  Even though it can get pretty busy on the weekends, they try to get you your food as quickly as possible without sacrificing the quality.  They have good food for everyone and room for large crowds making it a great place to eat.</p></body></html>
