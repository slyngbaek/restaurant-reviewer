<p>Eureka Burger is restaurant in downtown San Luis Obispo that serves gourmet burgers, salads, fries, and a variety of beers. Although the burgers are a little pricey, at around $12, their variety and uniqueness set them apart. The fig marmalade burger I ordered came with goat cheese and arugula, something hard to find at other burger joints. These unique flavors came nicely together and provided for a delicious meal. The other notable part of the meal was the large number of beers they had on tap.<br /><br />Our group consisted of about 19 people, which lead to a 35 minute wait to get seated since they don’t allow reservations. Although our group was large, the service still felt slow and it took us a while to get our food. The slow service was made up by the nice servers and the delicious meals, and to be fair, we did have an exceptionally large group.<br /><br />Eureka Burger is in the heart of downtown and can easily be walked to from most of the area. The inside is dimly lit and has really high ceilings. In general the atmosphere is positive and everyone was really talkative, we even took pictures with the table next to us. The bar area showcases a plethora of beers on tap and adds to the fun “hang-out” atmosphere. The upstairs area consists of a more relaxed lounge area, better for smaller groups.<br /><br />Overall, Eureka Burger has a fun atmosphere and delicious food. Although its a little pricey, the unique ingredients in the burgers provide for a one-of-a-kind burger experience. The slow service can be overlooked by the good attitude of the waitresses. Eureka Burger might not be an everyday restaurant but its worth it to try the unique burgers at least once.</p></body></html>
